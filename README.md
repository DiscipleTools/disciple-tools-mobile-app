## Basic Design Idea

![Basic Design Idea](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-mobile-app-plugin/raw/master/mobile-app-design.png)

## Notable Design Decisions

General:

- Offline-First via FIFO Request Queue for API writes
- Aggressive data fetching for Posts (Contacts, Groups, etc... not Notifications or Comments/Activities where we implement Pagination/InfiniteScrolling), preferring GET ALL vs. Pagination (so that data is available offline)
- Not quite complete feature-parity offline - eg, Search works offline, but Filtering/Grouping only works online (for now?)
- CNonces: Login (10 sec) and PIN (30 sec)
- (Coming soon) Accessibility (double as Test IDs?)

UI/Framework-specific:

- Functional Components vs. Class
- Modular component design to mirror D.T Post Types and Fields, and dynamically respond to API changes, and support plugins
- Custom Hooks - map well to REST endpoints 
- SWR (stale-while-revalidate), also meets requirement for background fetching, onFocus fetching (prevent stale data on refocus of app)
- Redux vs. Context - Redux enables Persistence (plus Flux pattern is nice)
- Skeletons vs. Spinners
- Minimize 3rd party dependencies where possible (even if a noticeable impact to UI/UX, so long as minor impact)
- "Over-use" SecureStore - in addition to obvious values like PIN, password, we also store URL/domain, username (if user specifies to 'Remember Login Details', then we also keep URL/domain, username in Redux as before)
- Component Library: Native Base (may switch to React Native Paper?)
- (Coming soon) Themes with fallback to D.T logo(s) and color scheme

## Installation (Development)

- [Set up React Native (expo)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

```
npm install
npm start
```

Currently pure React Native, can be 'ejected' to integrate native code when the need arises.

## Installation (Demo)

To try out the app without setting up the development environment, download the "expo" app on iOS or Android:

[Expo Client (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779?mt=8)

[Expo Client (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US)

Then open the url https://expo.io/@discipletools/discipletoolsapp to view within the expo app.

## DataStore

Information on the redux setup for managing data: [Data Store](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-mobile-app/tree/master/store)

## Tests

Run all tests:

```
npm run test
```

Run individual tests by search pattern:

```
npx jest MySearchQuery
npx jest TextField
npx jest components/*
```
